# dapnet-example-golang
Same as the nodejs version, but in Go. Please see `dapnet-example-nodejs` for the story.

## Building
The binary provided is an example for linux x86-64. Build your own with `go build dapnetcall.go`

## Setting up
dapnetcall relies on environment variables. Set `DAP_OWNCALL`, `DAP_APIUSER` and `DAP_APIPASS` accordingly!

## Running
Execute the binary, use `-call` for the destination call, `-message` for the text to send and `-tx` for the transmitter group.
